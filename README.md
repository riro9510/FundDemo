🚀 Full Stack Demo – Node.js + React + JWT + AES-256

 I challenged myself to build a full-stack demo project in just 12 hours… that became 18… then 20… and almost 24 before I finally stopped 😅. It's not perfect, but it showcases modern web development skills and clean architecture. 
Key Highlights: 
🔹 Full stack: Node.js backend + React frontend in a monorepo. 
🔹 Secure data: Donor info stored encrypted with AES-256. 
🔹 JWT simulation: Token-based session management via WebSocket — token lifespan is 5 minutes, just like real-world dynamic CVV flows in banking apps. 
🔹 Polished frontend: Custom hooks, type-safe API requests, dynamic encoding/decoding of data. 
🔹 API docs: Fully documented with Swagger, including auth workflow.

 This project demonstrates my ability to:
 ✅ Build scalable, modular, and secure applications.
 ✅ Deliver working software under tight deadlines.
 ✅ Maintain clean, maintainable code.
